Creating and maintaining these products is a massive and exciting challenge. While each platform product has its own dedicated engineering team, design for the entire platform product family is the responsibility of the Platforms and Technology design team.</p>\n            <p class="m-t-20">Initially, we worked on only a handful of platform products directly, but as the positive impact of our work became apparent, we began to receive design support requests from additional teams. The prospect of collaborating with these teams excited us. However, if we wanted these new partnerships to be successful, we needed to find a way to scale our design workflow in a way that would allow us to work cross-functionally with a broader range of products and engineering teams.</p>\n        </div>\n        <div class="box bg-size-cover m-t-30" style="height: 446px; \n                    background-image: url(\'/images/play/content-img-2.png\');\n                    background-position: bottom;\n                    border:none;">\n        </div>  \n        <div class="p-x-100">\n            <p class="is-grey-700 upper font-12" style="text-align:center;">With so many platform products, we needed to find a way to scale</p>\n            <h3 class="m-t-45">Discovering Opportunities to Scale</h3>\n            <p class="m-t-15">Before forging these new partnerships we explored our existing platform product family and workflow to identify opportunities for growth. An audit of our platforms revealed that they shared the same components (buttons, navigation, selection controls, etc) but the visual design and user experience of the components varied from product to product.</p>\n            <p class="m-t-15">Based on these findings it became clear that the solution was to develop a design system of visually consistent components and a corresponding front-end framework. The unified visual design of these components would allow front-end developers from multiple products to work cross-functionally to develop them. This would result in a universal framework that could be used by all of our platform products rather than just one. <span class="link">This thinking led to the creation of Denali \u2014 a scalable, comprehensive, and themeable design system. </span> Overtime, Denali allowed us to unify the user experience across our platform product family and facilitate efficient front-end development.</p>\n            <h3 class="m-t-38">The Denali Design System</h3>\n            <p class="m-t-15"><span class="link">Denali</span> is Yahoo\u2019s first platform focused design system.
