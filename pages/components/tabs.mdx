# Tabs
Tabs are a navigation component that allow users to move between different screens and data sets. Another way to think of Tabs is like the tabs within a paper folder that allow you to organize files. They are available in primary and secondary styles.

## Foundation
Depending on your use of Primary or Secondary Tabs, the foundation elements can vary, but all do contain Body Copy.

#### Primary
Primary Tabs are placed within a container. The active state is styled in black with a white tab like border around it. Inactive Tabs are colored with the primary color of the brand at a 50% opacity. Disabled tabs use the same styling as any disabled text.

#### Secondary
Secondary Tabs do not utilize a background and are maintained above a line divider in the color or the brand at 50% opacity. The active state is styled in black with a brand colored line to add visual hierarchy. Inactive Tabs are colored with the primary color of the brand at a 50% opacity. Disabled tabs use the same styling as any disabled text.

#### Padding
In order to maintain visual balance, we recommend giving a minimum 40px padding between the tabs.

## Placement

#### General usage
Tabs are generally, but not limited to being used at the top of a UI right under the Navigation Bar. Alternatively, Tabs can be utilized within a Card component.

#### Margin
Adequate margins between Tab component and other components is important to maintaining discoverability and scannability. We recommend maintaining a minimum 20 pixel margin between Tabs and other components.
