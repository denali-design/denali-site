## Foundation
Navbar can contain any combination of the following sub-components: A background, a logo of the product or service, Menu Items to supporting pages, a search field and icons that can be used for a number of actions.

#### Title
Backgrounds should be 60 px tall and have a width that is determined by the width of the window. Backgrounds should be colored appropriately to align with branding of product or service.

#### Logo
svg or png versions of the logo should not exceed a maximum height of 34 px in order to provide enough margin around the logo to be clearly legible.

#### Menu Items
These are links to supporting pages. An underline, color change of weight change is used to show the user what page they are currently on.

#### Search
A search in the navbar acts as a global search across the product or service. 

#### Icons 
Icons are used for a number of different uses. You can use an icon such as menu-dialpad to house a menu to other products. You can use Icons such as question-mark or user-profile to present alternative product or service level settings. You can also include third-party icons such as slack to allow a user links to external platforms

Components in a Navbar should maintain a minimum padding of 10 px along the top, bottom, right, and left of each component to provide proper legibility.

## Placement

#### General usage
We suggest always placing Navbars at the top most area of a UI. Please keep in mind the amount of components within a Navbar as it is not advisable to over saturate this component.

<SingleImage 
  type="do"
  caption="use a hamburger icon to house menu items if you they get long enough to interfier with other elements padding."

/>

<SingleImage 
  type="dont"
  caption="place more than menu items on a navbar than you have space for."
