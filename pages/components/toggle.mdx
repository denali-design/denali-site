# Toggle
Toggles are a group of selectable options that are related to each other. The options are contained within a single component and one option is always selected by default. Toggles are available in default and small sizes.

## Foundation
Toggles are made up of a background container with a smaller container inside that holds either text or icons.

#### States
Toggles always contain one active state with at least one or more inactive or disabled states.

#### Padding
In order to maintain visual balance, we recommend not providing any padding between toggles. This allows the user to perceive its connectivity.

## Placement

#### General usage
Similar to Tabs, Toggles are used to hide smaller sets of data under this system which can be displayed per the users interaction.

#### Margin
Adequate margins between Toggle component and other components is important to maintaining discoverability and scannability. We recommend maintaining a minimum 20 pixel margin between Tabs and other components.
