## Foundation
A Switch is made up of a track, which the”thumb” follows either left or right depending on the state.

#### Track
The track is an element used to guide the Thumb between alternating states.

#### Thumb
The Thumb is a circular element on the switch that the user interacts with to turn something on or off.

#### States
Along with an on and off state, Switches can also be disable. This switch also includes a hover state to show if a switch is actionable. This Hover state is used primarily on web based experience and should not be implemented into mobile or tablet experiences.

Margin
Always maintain a minimum 20 pixel margin between Switch or components so that they do not become lost.

## Placement

#### General usage
Radios are very flexible components that can be placed anywhere you need to provide a user with an on and off option if used correctly.
