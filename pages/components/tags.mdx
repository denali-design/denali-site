## Foundation
Tags are made up of a container and text. Optionally, you can include both a descriptive icon and remove icon where desired. 

#### Required
A container is used to house all the elements in the tag. We currently offer containers in a solid and outlined version. Names, descriptions, actions can all be expressed with the text.

#### Optional
Icons can be included to tag to add clear visual understanding to the tags. Delete icons can also be used inside of tags.

#### Padding
In order to maintain visual balance, we recommend giving a minimum 40px padding between the tabs.

## Placement

#### General usage
Tags can primarily be used, but not limited to the following scenarios: As an input tag to visually represent what a user has added to a search input. Choice Tags that allow users to select 1 or many options presented. Similarly to Choice Tags, you can use Tags as a way for users to filter between options

#### Margin
Adequate margins between Tag component and other components is important to maintaining discoverability and scannability. We recommend maintaining a minimum 20 pixel margin between Tabs and other components.
