# Modals
Modals are used to present an important message or required task(s) to a user. Modals can be placed in front of a locked screen with a slight background or completely cover an existing page. Ideally all modal should contain a way for the user to return to the previous page, whether it be by a close icon or a close button.

## Foundation
Modals are constructed within a background overlay (Scrim) and container. They are a very flexible component in that they can be filled with a variety of content. Typically you can find a combination of the following components: Title, Header, Footer, Body Copy and a Button.

#### Title
Titles within a modal should contain text that directly refers to the message or task(s) displayed below.

#### Body Copy
The body copy within a modal is utilized to further clear up a message or task(s) being presented.

#### Header
A header can be added to a modal to create visual separation between content inside the modal. A header is indicated by a divider in the top half of the container. Headers also contain an “X” icon which is used to allow the user and exit from the modal experience.

#### Footer
A footer can be added to a modal to create visual separation between content inside the modal. A footer is indicated by a divider in the lower half of the container. 

#### Button
Buttons in a modal are used to either confirm or deny the message or task(s) being presented to the user.

#### Padding
Components in a modal should have consistent padding between each other to be clearly legible and scannable. We recommend providing a minimum padding of 10 px along the top, bottom, right, and left of each component in a modal.

## Placement

#### General usage
We suggest always placing modals in the middle of the UI. Additionally please keep in mind of the amount of content within a modal and provide the adequate size container to house the content.

<DoubleImage 
  firstType="do"
  firstImage="/images/components/modals/placement-general-do.png"
  firstCaption="use  a small modal to contain an alert."
  secondType="dont"
  secondImage="/images/components/modals/placement-general-dont.png"
  secondCaption="use a large modal to contain an alert."
/>

#### Margin
Adequate margins between Modal components and edge of page is important to maintaining discoverability. We recommend maintaining a minimum 60 pixel margin between the modal and the edge of the page.
