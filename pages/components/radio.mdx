## Foundation
Radio controls are made up of an item/option, which contains the circular selector and a label.

#### Selector
The selector is a circle with a 2 px border. This can exist in multiple states like: Unselected, Unselected Disabled, Unselected Hover, Select and Selected Disabled.

#### Padding
Always maintain a minimum of (?) pixel margin between selector and label to maintain legibility.

#### Margin
Always maintain a minimum 10 pixel margin between Radios or components so that they do not become lost.
